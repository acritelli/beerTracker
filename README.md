# Features
 
* All announced beers already added
* Track ratings and tasting notes
* Download your ratings as an Excel spreadsheet after the event
* Ability to add breweries and beers not listed
* Ability to mark a beer as "must try" so that you can only view a list of the beers that you absolutely want to taste
* Free sign-up, with no account creation required

# Why not just use Untappd?

Untappd is awesome! I just find it tedious to try searching for beers while I'm at beer tasting events. I usually end up carrying around a slip of paper to take notes on (and see others doing the same). Additionally, there are those who do not use Untappd.

Currently, you can export your notes in an Excel file and manually enter them into Untappd. 

# Docs

More documentation will be coming soon once additional features are added.
