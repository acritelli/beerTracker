# Why not just use Untappd?

Untappd is awesome! I just find it tedious to try searching for beers while I'm at beer tasting events. I usually end up carrying around a slip of paper to take notes on (and see others doing the same). Additionally, there are those who do not use Untappd.

Currently, you can export your notes in an Excel file and manually enter them into Untappd. 

**It is my hope to integrate this with Untappd. I've made a request for an API key, and we'll see what happens.**

More documentation will be coming soon once additional features are added.
