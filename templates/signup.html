                <h2>Why not just use Untappd?</h2>
                <p>Untappd is awesome! I just find it tedious to try searching for beers while I'm at beer tasting events. I usually end up carrying around a slip of paper to take notes on (and see others doing the same). Having a simple interface to quickly jot down notes and rate my favorite beers will hopefully make this easier. Plus, you can export the notes to an Excel file and manually enter them into Untappd later. It's definitely not seamless, but I personally prefer it to looking up every single brew during the event.</p>
