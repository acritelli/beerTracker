                <p>Beer Tracker is designed to provide a way to track beer consumption at the 2017 Flour City Brewers Fest. It was created by <a href="http://www.acritelli.com">Anthony Critelli</a></p>

                <p>Answers to potential questions:</p>

                <h2>Why not just use Untappd?</h2>
                <p>Untappd is awesome! I just find it tedious to try searching for beers while I'm at beer tasting events. I usually end up carrying around a slip of paper to take notes on (and see others doing the same). Having a simple interface to quickly jot down notes and rate my favorite beers will hopefully make this easier. Plus, you can export the notes to an Excel file and manually enter them into Untappd later. It's definitely not seamless, but I personally prefer it to looking up every single brew during the event.</p>

                <h2>Can it do x,y,z?</h2>
                <p>Probably not, but I'd like to actually improve upon this (assuming people use it). Feel free to email your suggestions to critellia AT gmail dot com.</p>

                <h2>What's the technology stack?</h2>
                <p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/acritelli/beerTracker">Github.</a> Some additional info:</p>
                <p>Backend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python - uses the Flask framework</li>
                    <li>MongoDB - let me focus on quickly building the app, since I didn't have to put much thought into data design (i.e. let me be lazy).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Frontend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS - Bootstrap</li>
                    <li>Javascript - jQuery</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>I lost my URL</h2>
                <p>I can't believe you've done this. Send me an email, the name you used for registration, and the approximate date and time that you created your account: critellia AT gmail dot com</p>
                <p>One of the improvements for this app is absolutely going to be improved authentication. I just needed something quick and dirty</p>

                <h2>Why the troupstreet.com domain?</h2>
                <p>Just a spare domain that I had hanging around doing nothing.</p>
