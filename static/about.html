                    <h1><i class="fa fa-beer" aria-hidden="true"></i>  About Beer Tracker</h1>
                    <p>Beer Tracker is designed to provide a way to track beer consumption at the 2017 Rochester Real Beer Expo. It was created by <a href="http://www.acritelli.com">Anthony Critelli</a></p>

                    <p>Answers to potential questions:</p>

                    <h2>Why not just use Untappd?</h2>
                    <p>Untappd is awesome! I just find it tedious to try searching for beers while I'm at beer tasting events. I usually end up carrying around a slip of paper to take notes on (and see others doing the same). Having a simple interface to quickly jot down notes and rate my favorite beers will hopefully make this easier. Plus, you can export the notes to an Excel file and manually enter them into Untappd later. It's definitely not seamless, but I personally prefer it to looking up every single brew during the event.</p>

                    <h2>Can it do x,y,z?</h2>
                    <p>Probably not, but I'd like to actually improve upon this (assuming people use it). Feel free to email your suggestions to critellia AT gmail dot com.</p>

                    <h2>What's the technology stack?</h2>
                    <p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/acritelli/beerTracker">Github.</a> Some additional info:</p>
                    <p>Backend:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python - uses the Flask framework</li>
                        <li>MongoDB - let me focus on quickly building the app, since I didn't have to put much thought into data design (i.e. let me be lazy).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Frontend:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS - Bootstrap</li>
                        <li>Javascript - jQuery</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Why does the code suck?</h2>
                    <p>Yeah...it's really, really rough. This was written in like 2 days (spontaneous Saturday decision the week before the expo), and I'm not a web developer. The code definitely needs a lot of work, but I wanted to get something at least working for the event, and I have other stuff going on.</p>

                    <p>My goal is to improve on this before the Flour City Brewers Fest. Refactoring and design work are all part of the plan. If you have suggestions, please feel free to email them to me: critellia AT gmail dot com.</p>

                    <h2>I lost my URL</h2>
                    <p>I can't believe you've done this. Send me an email, the name you used for registration, and the approximate date and time that you created your account: critellia AT gmail dot com</p>
                    <p>One of the improvements for this app is absolutely going to be improved authentication. I just needed something quick and dirty</p>

                    <h2>Why the troupstreet.com domain?</h2>
                    <p>Just a spare domain that I had hanging around doing nothing.</p>
